Spots and marks faces on your picture!<br/>
This website is using jwt tokens, so you don't have to log in after refreshing page.

I developed this using:<br/>
[![List](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react,nodejs,postgres,redis,docker)](https://skillicons.dev) <br/>
And [Clarifai face-detection API](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection) <br/>

And all of this is hosted on render

To start:
1. Just use my website: https://facespotterai.onrender.com/

**Keep in mind that registering/signing in may take some time due to the free hosting limitations!**
