Spots and marks faces on your picture!<br/>
This website is using jwt tokens, so you don't have to log in after refreshing page.

I developed this using:<br/>
[![List](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react,nodejs,express,postgres,redis,docker,aws,postman,bootstrap)](https://skillicons.dev) <br/>
And [Clarifai face-detection API](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection) <br/>

[![List](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=postgres)](https://skillicons.dev) Used for storing user data<br/>
[![List](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=redis)](https://skillicons.dev) Used for storing JWT tokens<br/>
[![List](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=aws)](https://skillicons.dev) Lambda used in ranking system<br/>

And all of this is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/)

To start:
1. Just use my website: https://facespotterai.onrender.com/

**Keep in mind that registering/signing in may take some time due to the free hosting limitations!** (up to 50s delay)
